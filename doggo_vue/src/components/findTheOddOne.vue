    <h2>This game mode is not design yet.</h2>
    <p>This game mode is not design yet, I will finished it only if I think I still have time.</p>
    <p>This game mode will also changed to "Find the Same Breed" instead of "Find the Odd One", basically you play like this - in every round, there will be, for example, 5 random images showing up, 2 of them is the same breed, other 3 are not, so you have to choose that 2 images in order to get correct answer. The cheat mode use same logic as the game mode "Guess the Breed", the more you cheat, the more answer option you have to choose inside. Cheat will help you get the answer easier, but if you cheat too much you found it is harder to get correct answer.</p>
