# Doggo - A dog bread guessing game

* **About this project:** Dog bread guessing game. This is my first Vue.js front-end project, a dog breed guessing game. The most important thing I learned by this project is, problem solving skills, and the wisdom of handling complexity of natural, with human friendly (simple for human) way.
* **App live website:** [Gh-pages](https://treegb.github.io/doggo/) (branch). This is the real deployment location.
* **About { master } branch and { gp-pages } branch** The main code is all <code>push</code> and <code>pull</code> [ to ]-[ from ] <code>master</code> branch, while the deployment files will be push to <code>gh-pages</code>, and content inside <code>gh-pages</code> will [ automatically ]-[ magically ] be served as web content by github. In other word, I write code in master branch, then when we finished, we <code>build</code> (generate html files) then push it to gh-pages branch.
* **Implemented with:** <code>Vue.js</code>.
* **(About { markdown } language):** See [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
